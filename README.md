# Pattern Discovery in Noisy Human Cyclic Data

# Motivation
Why averages fail for human behavioral data.

# Approach
- Variability-based feature engineering
- PCA for latent structure
- HDBSCAN for unsupervised grouping

# Key Findings
- Instability is multi-dimensional
- Natural behavioral clusters emerge without labels
- Lifestyle differences appear post-hoc

# Notes
This is exploratory research code, not production code.
